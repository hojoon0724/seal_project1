## Details about the API

Brief Description of the API I'm using and how I plan to use it. Does it use authentication?

Sample Fetch/Ajax called:

```js
const url = "https://www.perfumeapi.com/ingredients";
fetch(url)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data));
```

The Data I get back:

```json
[
  {
    "ingredient": "Bergamot",
    "description": "A citrus fruit with a bright, uplifting scent."
  },
  {
    "ingredient": "Lavender",
