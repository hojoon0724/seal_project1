## Project Description

> This project uses the Spaceflight News API to show tiles of the latest news related to space exploration. The user can also search with keywords.

## Details about the API

The API does not use any authentication. The requests will be made with a URL in accordance to their API guidelines

Sample Fetch/Ajax called:

```js
const baseURL = "https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/articles/";
  fetch(url)
    .then((res) => {
      return res.json();
    })
    .then((data) => {
      newsArray = data.results;
    }
```

The Data I get back:

```json
{
    "count": 18728,
    "next": "https://api.spaceflightnewsapi.net/v4/articles/?format=json&limit=24&offset=24",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
      {
